# Welcome to my repository!

This is the repository for my first classification project where I tested a lot of different classification models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine classifier, Adaboost, and Catboost. The model will predict whether or not the customer will subsribe to a term deposit if given a phone call.
